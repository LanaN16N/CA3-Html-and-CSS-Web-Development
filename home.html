        <h2>About My Town</h2>
        <!-- Text paragraphs with the most important information about my town. -->
        <p>Varazdin is a wonderfully pretty baroque town located about 90km northeast of Zagreb and only about 45km from the Hungarian border. The town has a number of fine sights to explore, but it is also a delight to walk the streets, examining the impressive architecture, popping into a museum or two and enjoying the food and drink on offer. Varazdin is also home to the incredibly lively and fun Spancirfest each August – the largest street festival in Croatia. </p>
        <p>With 46.946 inhabitants and the average annual temperature of 10°C, the city of Varaždin is one of the most attractive destinations to live in or to visit in Croatia. It is the tourist, cultural, economical, educational and sporting centre of North-western Croatia. </p>
        <p>Varazdin – known as “Little Vienna” among Croatians – owes its Baroque bonanza to its position as Croatia’s capital from 1756 to 1776. In that year, unfortunately, a large part of the town was destroyed in a fire. (The capital reverted to Zagreb at this point.) </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In 2023, the city joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network </strong> which promotes cities that celebrate culture and creativity as part of their strategic development. Varazdin has joined the network due to its focus on music.
