        <h2>History</h2>
        <!-- Text paragraphs with the most important information about the history of my town. -->
        <p>
          <strong>The Vindija cave in Donja Voca near Varazdin was the place where the best preserved Neanderthal remains were discovered, which date back to about 30,000 years.</strong> The city's area was already inhabited during Roman times, as evidenced by archaeological findings.
        </p>
        <p>The history of Varazdin is closely connected to the history of Varazdin during the medieval period. Some believe that there was a tribal county in Varazdin prior to the 12th century. A large County of Varazdin was created in 1350 as a result of the reorganization of counties, which included nearby counties. The County of Varazdin was divided into smaller districts starting in the mid-14th century that largely aligned with the old counties.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>King Bella III mentions Garestin (the old name for Varazdin) for the first time in 1181 in a legal document. In 1209, the Hungarian monarch Andrew II ruled over Varazdin and made it a free royal borough.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>At the close of the 14th century, the Varazdin fortress became under the jurisdiction of the Counts of Celje. In the centuries that followed, Varazdin had multiple owners. Margrave Georg's wife, Beatrice Frankopan, was responsible for building the town hall, and she was one of the most influential individuals. Finally, Baron Ivan Ungnad enhanced the existing fortification. At the conclusion of the 16th century, it was owned by Count Thomas Erdody, who also assumed the role of Varazdin prefect. The Erdody family kept the fortress in their possession until 1925.</p>
        <p>In 1756, the Ban Ferenc NÃ¡dasdy chose Varazdin as his official residence, and Varazdin became the capital of all of Croatia. It hosted the Croatian Sabor and the Royal Croatian Council founded by Empress Maria Theresa.</p>
        <p>The periods of the Reformation and counter-reformation had a great influence on Varazdin. The gymnasium and Jesuit house were created as a result of the Jesuits' arrival, and churches and other buildings were constructed in the Barocco style. Many Croatian noblemen chose Varazdin as their seat in the 18th century, and it was later renamed the administrative center of Croatia in 1756. Most of the town was destroyed by the 1776 fire, which led to the administrative institutions moving back to Zagreb. Varazdin County was located in Varazdin, and it was once the capital of Vasazdin County in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, under the rule of the Kingdom of Hungary after the compromise of 1867. Both names are visible on the 1881 Hungarian stamp. In the 19th century, Varazdin had been completely rebuilt and expanded, resulting in flourishing craft and trade, as well as the production of silk and bricks. The theatre, music school, and fire department came into existence.</p>
        <h2>20th century</h2>
        <p> Varazdin became the industrial center of Northwestern Croatia during the 20th century. Tivar, a textile manufacturer, was established in 1918. On July 12th, 1941, Varazdin was recognized as Judenfrei by the Ustase, which made it the first Croatian city to achieve this controversial distinction. During the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, Varazdin only experienced direct suffering for a few days due to the swift surrender of the massive Yugoslav People's Army base. The Croatian army was given $600m worth of weapons and there were no casualties as a result.</p>
