              <h4>Old Town Fortress</h4>
              <p>Situated in the northwestern section of Varazdin's central area, this magnificent fortress underwent construction, renovation, and expansions from the 13th to the 19th centuries. Currently, the castle hosts the Varazdin City Museum, established in 1925.</p>
              <p>Varazdin’s main square, Trg Kralja Tomislava (King Tomislav Square), is a wide square on which a number of inviting outdoor cafes are arranged. You will also find the Town Hall here – its central spire is somewhat unusual! Built in 1523, it is one of the oldest town halls in Europe.</p>

              <h4>HNK Varazdin - National Theatre of Croatia</h4>
              <p>A monumental building of the Croatian National Theatre was built in Historicist style at the southern entrance to the city in 1873. </p>
              <p>The building was designed by the most famous Central European theatre designer, the Viennese architect Hermann Helmer, for whom this was the first theatre project. In many respects it could be argued that his later works reflect echoes of the Varaždin Theatre.</p>

              <p>Dravski park-forest is a forested area in the northern part of the city of Varaždin, bordered to the north by the Drava River. It was declared a park-forest in 2011, covering an area of 85.74 hectares.
