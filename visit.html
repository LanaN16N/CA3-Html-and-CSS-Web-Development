              <h4>Old Town Fortress</h4>
              <p>Located in the northwest part of Varazdin's central area, this magnificent fortress was constructed, renovated, and expanded from the 13th to the 19th centuries. The Varazdin City Museum, established in 1925, is currently located in the castle. <br>There are many outdoor cafes around the fortress.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>It is the best thing to see in Varazdin and one of the best things to see in Croatia.</strong>

              <p>A number of inviting outdoor cafes have been set up on the wide square of Trg Kralja Tomislava (King Tomislav Square), the main square of Varazdin. The Town Hall is also located here - its central spire is a bit unusual! It is considered one of the oldest town halls in Europe, having been built in 1523.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>It is a place to go for coffee lovers as it is the centre of the strong coffee culture in the northern part of Croatia.</strong>

              <p>A monumental building of the Croatian National Theatre was built in the Historicist style at the city's southern entrance in 1873.</p>
              <p>The building was designed by the most famous Central European theatre designer, the Viennese architect Hermann Helmer, and this was his first theatre project. In many aspects, it could be argued that his later works echoed the Varaždin Theatre.</p>

              <p>Dravski Park Forest is a forested area in the northern part of the city of Varazdin. In 2011, it was declared a park-forest with a total area of 85.74 hectares.
