Web Design Report    

Introduction   
Since we had only two weeks to complete the project, I decided to keep things simple. 
Adopting the simpler design approach would enable me to achieve a better responsive design outcome, considering the time limit. Therefore, I prioritised minimalist design in my approach to the project. 

The biggest goal of this Web Project was to satisfy the conditions posted in the Assessment pdf file and present my city in the best possible way. 
This website focuses on showing visitors or potential visitors the beauty of my town. I mostly used Wikipedia text but put it in my own words.   

Main part   
This website has several pages:   
index.html - logo with three buttons to get to the other parts of the page. 
home.html - general information about the town. 
history.html - information about the town's past   
visit.html - details on places to visit and essential experiences for tourists, plus buttons with external links to other information, such as where to eat, sleep, and have fun. 

Each page, except index.html, has the header, nav, main, section, and footer to clearly define each part of the site. 

I put my Navigation bar in the header. The Navigation bar is fixed, and 0 from the top to ensure it is positioned at the top and that it stays then when scrolling.  
I chose a simple navigation design, using a dark menu bar and light-grey navigation that is universally acceptable to most people. The active link has the pure white text colour.  

I have made direct references in my HTML file comments for the few things that I used from w3 school, such as Bootstrap link and Bootstrap scripts. 
I used this link for Bootstrap scripts: "https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_navbar_collapse".
I also used the Bootstrap classes "navbar-toggler" and "navbar-toggler-icon" to create a responsive navigation menu with an interactive toggle icon that can be opened or closed with a click on smaller screens.       

I used a white smoke background for the site's body and a very dark grey22  font. This ensured readability while avoiding potential eye strain. 
For the customised background of the index page, I used pure white, which was also the background of my banner image. 
The colour shades of body elements, except for index.html, would remain the same across all pages. 

I used a white background and a grey box shadow for the main content. I also used margins and paddings here to add the focus to this part. 

For the footer, I used the same background shade as I used for the navigation bar. The text colour of the footer is white. The footer also has 70% opacity, making my footer 30% transparent. 

I used a cobalt blue shade for buttons. On hover, buttons get a lighter shade, or to be more precise, the shade of dodger blue, which provides feedback to the user that buttons are clickable (interactive). The text colour is white for both regular and hover buttons. 
The contrast between the background and the buttons is good, ensuring that it will attract the user's attention. This is crucial for buttons. 

I used popular fonts (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif) to ensure that this page would be accessible to everyone. 

One of the main challenges I faced was creating a fully responsive web page. However, I overcame this obstacle by using relative units instead of absolute units. 
My code mostly used relative units such as %, rem, and wh instead of absolute ones such as px. The webpage must be responsive since many users use mobile devices and tablets. 
The problem with using, for example, the pixels (absolute unit) is that the element size would stay the same regardless of the screen size. It is easy to imagine that this would be a terrible practice. 

Using Bootstrap classes and a grid system, relative units, media tag, and other adjustments I made in the style.css external file, I did my best to make this site fully responsive on any screen. 
I struggled a little to make my navbar bar fully responsive, but this link helped me a lot: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_navbar_collapse   
I also made my images responsive by using the "img-fluid" Bootstrap class. 

I also encountered the problem of being unable to connect my Codio account with Github despite following the video instructions. 
As a result, I could not post as many commits as I planned due to time constraints, and I could not make them as descriptive for the same reason. 
To elaborate, the problem with GitHub was that I could not use my password to connect; I needed to use my GPG key. 
Also, sometimes, my git pushes did not transfer on time, resulting in the need to push them again, which led to duplicated commits. 

At first, I made my index page as my home page, thinking they were the same pages. 
Fortunately, our Lecturer provided us with clear instructions for creating our index.html, which I found to be extremely helpful.
But, unfortunately most of my Git commits for the index page are actually commits for the home page. 
Then, I created a home page and put inside the code that was initially for index.html, with some additional changes.
    

Conclusion   
The primary objectives of this website project were to meet the project requirements and highlight my city and web development skills to the best of my ability.  
While there were some challenges, I overcame most of them by taking the time to do most of the things correctly. 
The result is a user-friendly website that displays the charm and significance of Varazdin.
